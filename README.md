# burger_dog

Create a virtual environment-
```
conda create -n burger_dog python=3.7
conda activate burger_dog 
```

Once the virtual evironment is activated-
`pip install pygame`

Make the dog eat as many burgers! Move the dog UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT with arrow keys. Use SPACE BAR for a boost!
Burger points decrease as the burger falls closer to the bottom of the screen - catch those burgers higher up!
